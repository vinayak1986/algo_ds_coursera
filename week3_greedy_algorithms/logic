naive solution
------
form all possible permutations of the list
collapse each of them into a single number
Get the highest among these numbers

stress test
-----
Get a random number between 1 and 5
Get a random list of n (1 to 5, from above)numbers between 1 and 10
call the naive solution and the logic
If the two answers are different, exit the infinite loop and call it out
